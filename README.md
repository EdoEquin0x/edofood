Edofood is a project that I realized in order to improve my javascript and my PHP. It is a complete e-commerce site that offers a store system, shopping cart, administrator account and a dynamic content management solution to allow the administrator to update all the content of the store directly from his panel.
The project was made on XAMPP and should work flawlessly on it, in the case of an installation on a machine some adjustments may be necessary tho.
